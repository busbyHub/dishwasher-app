Thanks for the opportunity to work on this tech test. I hope that this will give a reasonable representation of my code writing approach and methodology. Some notes:

- I got to the test when I got back from holiday, a few days ago, so I've not completed as much of the "optional" section as I would have liked.
- I have written it in React as this was the library highlighted in the job specification. I could have written this in Angular, or perhaps, in vanilla JS too.
- I was unable to call the API directly from within the app due to CORS exceptions. However, I've written and architected code to show what I would have done in normal circumstances, and instead I've added the data locally (data.json an data2.json) and called that in from the components.
- Note: that I took data for the first ten products, so they are the only ones that will show the optional work showing.
- The app works primarily for latest 2 Chrome versions. I can imagine at John Lewis, as I currently have to, you are catering for a wide array of clients/browsers. I have written applications that have customers using IE8+ in the past.
- I have tried to write as much TypeScript as possible in the time, I'd have preferably mapped out the Api calls so that this would have been more fully featured and typed.

Many thanks
Dominic
